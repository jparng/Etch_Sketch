# Etch_Sketch
Description:

This is a project that utilizes DOM manipulation to create a browser based "Etch-a-Sketch"/sketchpad.

How to Use:
By using the mouse cursor to hover over the white grid, the user will create black squares within the box. The white grid has a default draw size 16 by 16 squares, and when you click on the reset button you will be prompted to input the number of squares you want to use to draw inside the grid. When you cancel the request to choose an integer or input something that is not an integer, you will cause an error that will return the draw size to the default and will have to reset again to be prompted again.
